We are building a full stack invoicing web application.

Your users should be able to:
View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Create, read, update, and delete invoices
Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
Toggle light and dark mode
Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
Add login page with authentication

## How to run the app

<ul>
<li> Create a ".env" file that will hold your "PORT" number and "MongoDB connection" string </li>
<li> Make a database in mongoDB. Copy the connection string to paste in the ".env" file </li>
<li> Add your .env file name to your gitignore file along with your node_modules folder name</li>
<li> Type in "npm install" to download all the packages and dependecies in the package.json file</li>
</ul>

* Run the app with 'npm start"
